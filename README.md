- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m sadeem abdulaziz
  
-ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m deeply interested in web development and data analysis, especially using powerful tools like Python and Power BI. I love turning ideas into interactive websites and transforming raw data into meaningful insights and visual stories.

-ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning and improving my skills in both fields â€” building responsive web applications and analyzing real-world datasets using Python and Power BI. Every project I work on helps me grow and get one step closer to becoming a skilled and creative developer and analyst.
